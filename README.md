# Web-Portfolio

This web portfolio is where I showcase my development skills, projects, a bit about me, and my experiences as a developer. It is always considered a work in progress, as I continue to update it when necessary.

In this repository I include bits of the code that people may find interesting or want to use for their own projects.
